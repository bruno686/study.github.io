# Self-introduction

### You can call me Bruno. I was an plain sophomore. Because I am poor at taking notes, and even if I took notes, I could not read what I wrote. So I set up this blog to connect to the github repository to store my notes. Welcome to study and communicate with me and make progress together. If you like my notes, please click star on github. Thank you!
